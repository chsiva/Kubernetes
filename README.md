# What you did with Kubernetes?
    Worked on setting up Docker Orchestration platform. Kubernetes for deployment of Docker containers on a large scale.
    Managed Kubernetes minions & masters to patch with latest security updates by evicting and uncording the nodes during the process.
    Managed local deployments in Kubernetes, creating local cluster and deploying application containers.
    Container management using Docker by writing Dockerfiles and set up the automated build on Docker HUB and installed and configuredKubernetes.
        
# Kubernetes Issues:
    some major issues with Kubernetes I came across was like 
    1. etcd member has no leader,  etcd is not available, or controller manager is unavailable, 
       Scheduler is unavailable. So these are the kind of issues I worked on before. 
       
# Monitoing
    Yes, basically in order to ensure any kind of like CPU usage or memory usage. I purposefully monitoring that using like application performance monitoring tools, using like APP dynamics. New Relic in order to ensure like average response time, load management and error checks and basically for setting up a high availability Kubernetes master are used to manage our Kubernetes master replicating that on different availability zones.
        
# Load Balancing Techniques
    So basically, I have used like Ingress controllers for load balancing techniques. basically for eliminating SSL and punch termination.


1. We use like custom resource definition file for "versioning within object persistent level".

2. Yes, we are using like persistent volumes have used like Trident and port walks. 

3. So, usually we can utilize any kind of like CNI methodology, like the container network interface. 
   Using like Calico or funnel,  so that where we can allocate like specific IP address with a specific namespaces in order to route the traffic 
   for a specific cluster.
   
# For code coverage static analysis, I have used like sonar cube, and veracode.

# Well basically we will be running up the all the configuration files like pulling data from the "Log Stash and storing that within Elasticsearch".
